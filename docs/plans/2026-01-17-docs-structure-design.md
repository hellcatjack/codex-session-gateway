# 2026-01-17 Documentation Structure Design

## Context and Goals
This documentation refresh aims to make the repository usable without tribal knowledge while keeping sensitive data out of version control. The audience includes operators who run the service, developers who debug it, and reviewers who need to see safety guardrails. The top-level README should provide an opinionated path: prerequisites, configuration choices, startup, and key operational commands. It must also link to deeper references rather than duplicating them, to avoid drift. Because the project is often used in constrained environments, the troubleshooting section needs to highlight permission, DBus, and network restrictions with concrete remediation steps. At the same time, examples must remain safe: use placeholders, avoid real tokens, and avoid leaking user identifiers. A clean documentation information architecture should let new contributors answer three questions quickly: “How do I run it?”, “How do I configure it safely?”, and “Where are the deeper details?” It also clarifies which details belong in configuration examples versus policy documents, so operational knowledge can be updated without rewriting the whole README. This refresh therefore introduces a concise doc index, folds scattered notes into consistent sections, and keeps legacy plan documents available as history. Success is defined by a README that reads top-to-bottom without context switching, a single index that lists all doc assets, and a clear expectation of which files are source-of-truth versus archival notes.

## Structure and Maintenance
The structure uses three tiers. Tier 1 is the README, which acts as the entry point and includes features, quick start, configuration, commands, systemd usage, and restricted-environment troubleshooting. Tier 2 is the doc index, which points to security guidance and audit reports; this index is a lightweight map and should be updated whenever new documentation is added. Tier 3 is the plans directory, which preserves design decisions and one-off investigations. To keep maintenance light, the README includes only stable instructions and references the index for anything that is likely to change. The index adds a short note explaining that plan documents are historical and may not match current behavior. The update workflow is simple: update README when user-facing behavior or configuration changes, update the index when new docs are added, and update audits when a new scan is performed. Documentation changes should be reviewed alongside code changes in the same commit to keep behavior and instructions aligned and to reduce onboarding friction. As part of the refresh, examples remain minimal and use environment placeholders, and any operational commands are presented without embedded secrets. The result is a consistent, low-drift documentation set that supports both new users and ongoing maintenance over time.
